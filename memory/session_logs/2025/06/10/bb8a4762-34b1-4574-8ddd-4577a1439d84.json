Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes. DLF is committed to waste minimisation and promoting efficient use of resources throughout the lifecycle of construction and portfolio management. It undertakes several measures to reduce, reuse or recycle waste generated from the business activities. - Project-specific plans are put in place for efficient resource use and waste recycling, prior to initiating construction. DLF also work with customers and waste disposal companies to introduce recycling systems into leases for rental buildings; - Contractors engaged in construction are encouraged to recover, reuse and recycle building materials; - The Company educates its employees, tenants and contractors on appropriate waste management techniques and support contractors to promote waste management awareness at its development sites, as required; and - All waste generated from business activities across all operations is recycled, reused, composted, treated for energy recovery, or sent to authorized recyclers for suitable handling. Waste Collection, Segregation and Management - It is a constant effort to ensure all generated waste is suitably treated and no waste is sent to landfill at all its sites. Construction waste generated during concreting and plastering process is collected, segregated and reused in filling underneath the stich slab. Steel scrap is used in non-structural members of the building to reduce waste. In addition, to divert 36 waste from landfills, DLF tries to source or sell to recycling facilities. For example, DLF has a battery buy-back policy. - DLF has established dedicated waste collection areas and waste separation facilities at its managed sites. Solid waste undergoes segregation in specific assigned areas, where it is directed for reuse, recycling, or energy recovery, depending on the type of waste. Three types of waste are segregated and monitored as mentioned below: a. Green Bin: Biodegradable organic waste such as food waste. Wet waste collected through these bins, is transferred to organic waste composters installed on-site for composting. The manure generated from this process is used as a fertilizer for horticulture purpose in landscaping. b. Blue Bin: Other non-hazardous recyclable waste such as plastic, paper, metal waste. This dry waste is further directed for reuse, recycling through authorised vendors or sent to waste-to-energy plants. c. Black Bin: Hazardous waste items such as sanitary waste and e-waste. The e-waste and hazardous waste like used lube oil and batteries are safely disposed through Government authorized vendors, in line with regulatory requirements. Measures to reduce use of hazardous material DLF has implemented a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for materials used in construction of its buildings. MSDS provides information on the potential hazards arising from chemical properties of a product including information on health effects, reactivity, storage, handling, disposal and spill/ leak procedures, enabling personnel to work safely with the chemical product. Materials are approved and handled appropriately based on the MSDS, which helps prevent the usage of materials with any toxic content.

No. 9. \\x07Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes. DLF is committed to waste minimisation and promoting efficient use of resources throughout the lifecycle of construction and portfolio management. It undertakes several measures to reduce, reuse or recycle waste generated from the business activities. - Project-specific plans are put in place for efficient resource use and waste recycling, prior to initiating construction. DLF also work with customers and waste disposal companies to introduce recycling systems into leases for rental buildings; - Contractors engaged in construction are encouraged to recover, reuse and recycle building materials; - The Company educates its employees, tenants and contractors on appropriate waste management techniques and support contractors to promote waste management awareness at its development sites, as required; and - All waste generated from business activities across all operations is recycled, reused, composted, treated for energy recovery, or sent to authorized recyclers for suitable handling. Waste Collection, Segregation and Management - It is a constant effort to ensure all generated waste is suitably treated and no waste is sent to landfill at all its sites. Construction waste generated during concreting and plastering process is collected, segregated and reused in filling underneath the stich slab. Steel scrap is used in non-structural members of the building to reduce waste. In addition, to divert 36 waste from landfills, DLF tries to source or sell to recycling facilities. For example, DLF has a battery buy-back policy. - DLF has established dedicated waste collection areas and waste separation facilities at its managed sites. Solid waste undergoes segregation in specific assigned areas, where it is directed for reuse, recycling, or energy recovery, depending on the type of waste. Three types of waste are segregated and monitored as mentioned below: a. Green Bin: Biodegradable organic waste such as food waste. Wet waste collected through these bins, is transferred to organic waste composters installed on-site for composting. The manure generated from this process is used as a fertilizer for horticulture purpose in landscaping. b. Blue Bin: Other non-hazardous recyclable waste such as plastic, paper, metal waste. This dry waste is further directed for reuse, recycling through authorised vendors or sent to waste-to-energy plants. c. Black Bin: Hazardous waste items such as sanitary waste and e-waste. The e-waste and hazardous waste like used lube oil and batteries are safely disposed through Government authorized vendors, in line with regulatory requirements. Measures to reduce use of hazardous material DLF has implemented a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for materials used in construction of its buildings. MSDS provides information on the potential hazards arising from chemical properties of a product including information on health effects, reactivity, storage, handling, disposal and spill/ leak procedures, enabling personnel to work safely with the chemical product. Materials are approved and handled appropriately based on the MSDS, which helps prevent the usage of materials with any toxic content.
