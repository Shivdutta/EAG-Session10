As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, first focused on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. Performance of initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers\\' rights. Given the strategy\\'s focus on leading management practices, we expect the growth curve for Sustainable Investing to again slope upward in the years ahead.\\n\\n### Daily \u2013 Vickers Top Buyers & Sellers for 05/23/2025\\n\\nThe Vickers Top Buyers & Sellers is a daily report that identifies the five companies the largest insider purchase transactions based on the dollar value of the transactions as well as the five companies the largest insider sales transactions based on the dollar value of the transactions.\\n\\n### Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 05/19/2025: Tariff Impact on U.S. Companies\\n\\nDirector of Research Jim Kelleher, CFA, has surveyed the Argus analyst team about the impact of tariffs on companies in the Argus Universe of Coverage. The tariff environment is dynamic, to say the least. The White House has levied tariffs or threatened to levy tariffs, but often paused, postponed, or withdrawn pledged tariffs. Most recently, China and the U.S. agreed to reduce baseline tariffs to 10% for 90 days (30% in the U.S. reflecting a 20% fentanyl penalty). More than the tariffs themselves, the lack of a finished tariff infrastructure complicates business planning, staffing decisions, and capital investment. Within this dynamic environment, companies are focused on taking actions in areas they can control and planning proactively for a range of tariff scenarios. Companies are anticipating both direct and indirect tariff impacts. Direct impacts would include higher costs for imported finished goods and components, foregone sales as a result of reciprocal tariffs in other nations, and other factors. For example, a manufacturing company would face direct impacts as it pays higher prices for imported parts. Indirect impacts would include a slowing in business related to a broad softening in the economy. All companies likely will feel indirect impacts. A utility, for example, could begin to see a slowing in industrial and commercial kilowatt-hour sales, particularly in niches such as warehousing, trucking and rail, and other freight-related functions. We asked Argus analysts to survey their companies for their commentary on direct and indirect tariff impacts, as well as actions these companies are taking to mitigate the challenging trade environment. Nearly every company in Argus analyst coverage has issued commentary regarding tariffs, much as (five years ago) nearly every company in coverage had something to say about the then-developing COVID-19 pandemic. Below we offer a sampling of company responses to the unfolding tariff environment across a range of sectors and industries. We intend to update our survey on a regular basis at least until the tariff environment, in whatever shape or form, becomes a stable part of the U.S. economy.\\n\\n\\n### Top Analysts: MSFT\\n\\nView More### Overall Score\\n\\nDiscover which analysts rank highest for MSFT overall weighted by direction, price target, and price movement.\\n\\nLearn More### Direction Score\\n\\nDiscover which analysts rank highest on predicting the directional movement of MSFT.\\n\\nLearn More### Price Score\\n\\nDiscover which analysts rank highest on predicting the price target of MSFT.\\n\\nLearn More')",

As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, first focused on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. Performance of initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers\\' rights. Given the strategy\\'s focus on leading management practices, we expect the growth curve for Sustainable Investing to again slope upward in the years ahead.\\n\\n### Daily \u2013 Vickers Top Buyers & Sellers for 05/23/2025\\n\\nThe Vickers Top Buyers & Sellers is a daily report that identifies the five companies the largest insider purchase transactions based on the dollar value of the transactions as well as the five companies the largest insider sales transactions based on the dollar value of the transactions.\\n\\n### Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 05/19/2025: Tariff Impact on U.S. Companies\\n\\nDirector of Research Jim Kelleher, CFA, has surveyed the Argus analyst team about the impact of tariffs on companies in the Argus Universe of Coverage. The tariff environment is dynamic, to say the least. The White House has levied tariffs or threatened to levy tariffs, but often paused, postponed, or withdrawn pledged tariffs. Most recently, China and the U.S. agreed to reduce baseline tariffs to 10% for 90 days (30% in the U.S. reflecting a 20% fentanyl penalty). More than the tariffs themselves, the lack of a finished tariff infrastructure complicates business planning, staffing decisions, and capital investment. Within this dynamic environment, companies are focused on taking actions in areas they can control and planning proactively for a range of tariff scenarios. Companies are anticipating both direct and indirect tariff impacts. Direct impacts would include higher costs for imported finished goods and components, foregone sales as a result of reciprocal tariffs in other nations, and other factors. For example, a manufacturing company would face direct impacts as it pays higher prices for imported parts. Indirect impacts would include a slowing in business related to a broad softening in the economy. All companies likely will feel indirect impacts. A utility, for example, could begin to see a slowing in industrial and commercial kilowatt-hour sales, particularly in niches such as warehousing, trucking and rail, and other freight-related functions. We asked Argus analysts to survey their companies for their commentary on direct and indirect tariff impacts, as well as actions these companies are taking to mitigate the challenging trade environment. Nearly every company in Argus analyst coverage has issued commentary regarding tariffs, much as (five years ago) nearly every company in coverage had something to say about the then-developing COVID-19 pandemic. Below we offer a sampling of company responses to the unfolding tariff environment across a range of sectors and industries. We intend to update our survey on a regular basis at least until the tariff environment, in whatever shape or form, becomes a stable part of the U.S. economy.\\n\\n\\n### Top Analysts: MSFT\\n\\nView More### Overall Score\\n\\nDiscover which analysts rank highest for MSFT overall weighted by direction, price target, and price movement.\\n\\nLearn More### Direction Score\\n\\nDiscover which analysts rank highest on predicting the directional movement of MSFT.\\n\\nLearn More### Price Score\\n\\nDiscover which analysts rank highest on predicting the price target of MSFT.\\n\\nLearn More')",
