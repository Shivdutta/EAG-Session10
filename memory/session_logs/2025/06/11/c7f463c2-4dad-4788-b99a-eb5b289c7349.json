Quantum computing is an emergent field of computer science and engineering that harnesses the unique qualities of quantum mechanics to solve problems beyond the ability of even the most powerful classical computers. The field of quantum computing includes a range of disciplines, including quantum hardware and quantum algorithms. While still in development, quantum technology will soon be able to solve complex problems that classical supercomputers can\u2019t solve (or can\u2019t solve fast enough). By taking advantage of quantum physics, large-scale quantum computers would be able to tackle certain complex problems many times faster than modern classical machines. With a quantum computer, some problems that might take a classical computer thousands of years to solve might be solved in a matter of minutes or hours. Quantum mechanics, the study of physics at very small scales, reveals surprising fundamental natural principles. Quantum computers specifically harness these phenomena to access mathematical methods of solving problems not available with classical computing alone. Practical applications for quantum computing In practice, quantum computers are expected to be broadly useful for two types of tasks: modeling the behavior of physical systems and identifying patterns and structures in information. Quantum mechanics is a bit like the operating system of the universe. A computer that uses quantum mechanical principles to process information has certain advantages in modeling physical systems. Therefore, quantum computing is of particular interest for chemistry and material science applications. For example, quantum computers might help researchers seeking useful molecules for pharmaceutical or engineering applications identify candidates more quickly and efficiently. Quantum computers can also process data by using mathematical techniques not accessible to classical computers. That means they can give structure to data and help discover patterns that classical algorithms alone might miss. In practice, this might be useful for applications ranging from biology (for example, protein folding) to finance. Today, much of the work of quantum computing research involves searching for algorithms and applications within these broad categories of expected use.

Four key principles of quantum mechanics When discussing quantum computers, it is important to understand that at the smallest scales, the universe behaves very differently from what we are used to in our day-to-day lives. Compared to what we learned in grade-school physics, the behaviors of quantum objects are often bizarre and counterintuitive. Describing the behaviors of quantum particles presents a unique challenge. Most common-sense paradigms for the natural world lack the vocabulary to communicate the surprising behaviors of quantum particles. But quantum mechanics reveals how the universe really works. Quantum computers take advantage of quantum mechanics by replacing traditional binary bit circuits with quantum particles called quantum bits, or qubits. These particles behave differently from bits, exhibiting unique properties that can be described only with quantum mechanics. To understand quantum computing, it is important to understand four key quantum mechanics principles: SuperpositionEntanglementDecoherenceInterference Superposition A qubit itself isn't very useful. But it can place the quantum information it holds into a state of superposition, which represents a combination of all possible configurations of the qubit. Groups of qubits in superposition can create complex, multidimensional computational spaces. Complex problems can be represented in new ways in these spaces. When a quantum system is measured, its state collapses from a superposition of possibilities into a binary state, which can be registered like binary code as either a zero or a one. Entanglement Entanglement is the ability of qubits to correlate their state with other qubits. Entangled systems are so intrinsically linked that when quantum processors measure a single entangled qubit, they can immediately determine information about other qubits in the entangled system. Interference Interference is the engine of quantum computing. An environment of qubits placed into a state of collective superposition structures information in a way that looks like waves, with amplitudes associated with each outcome. These amplitudes become the probabilities of the outcomes of a measurement of the system. These waves can build on each other when many of them peak at a particular outcome or cancel each other out when peaks and troughs interact. Amplifying a probability or canceling out others are both forms of interference. Decoherence Decoherence is the process in which a system in a quantum state collapses into a nonquantum state. It can be intentionally triggered by measuring a quantum system or by other environmental factors (sometimes these factors trigger it unintentionally). Generally speaking, quantum computing requires avoiding and minimizing decoherence. How the principles work together To better understand quantum computing, consider that two surprising ideas are both true. The first is that objects that can be measured as having definite states\u2014qubits in superposition with defined probability amplitudes\u2014behave randomly. The second is that distant objects\u2014in this case, entangled qubits\u2014can still behave in ways that, though individually random, are strongly correlated. A computation on a quantum computer works by preparing a superposition of computational states. A quantum circuit, prepared by the user, uses operations to entangle qubits and generate interference patterns, as governed by a quantum algorithm. Many possible outcomes are canceled out through interference, while others are amplified. The amplified outcomes are the solutions to the computation. How do quantum computers work? The primary difference between classical and quantum computers is that quantum computers use qubits instead of bits. While quantum computing does use binary code, qubits process information differently from classical computers. But what are qubits and where do they come from? What are qubits? While classical computers rely on bits (zeros and ones) to store and process data, quantum computers process data differently by using quantum bits (qubits) in superposition. A qubit can behave like a bit and store either a zero or a one, but it can also be a weighted combination of zero and one at the same time. When qubits are combined, their superpositions can grow exponentially in complexity: two qubits can be in a superposition of the four possible 2-bit strings, three qubits can be in a superposition of the eight possible 3-bit strings, and so on. With 100 qubits, the range of possibilities is astronomical. Quantum algorithms work by manipulating information in a way inaccessible to classical computers, which can provide dramatic speed-ups for certain problems\u2014especially when quantum computers and high-performance cl...

A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena. On small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing takes advantage of this behavior using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster[a] than any modern \"classical\" computer. Theoretically a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the art is largely experimental and impractical, with several obstacles to useful applications. The basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or \"quantum bit\"), serves the same function as the bit in classical computing. However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two \"basis\" states, a state that is in an abstract sense \"between\" the two basis states. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently and quickly. Quantum computers are not yet practical for real-world applications. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven to be challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research aimed at developing scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Example implementations include superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields). In principle, a classical computer can solve the same computational problems as a quantum computer, given enough time. Quantum advantage comes in the form of time complexity rather than computability, and quantum complexity theory shows that some quantum algorithms are exponentially more efficient than the best-known classical algorithms. A large-scale quantum computer could in theory solve computational problems that are not solvable within a reasonable timeframe for a classical computer. This concept of additional ability has been called \"quantum supremacy\". While such claims have drawn significant attention to the discipline, near-term practical use cases remain limited. History[edit] For a chronological guide, see Timeline of quantum computing and communication. For many years, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science formed distinct academic communities.[1] Modern quantum theory developed in the 1920s to explain perplexing physical phenomena observed at atomic scales,[2][3] and digital computers emerged in the following decades to replace human computers for tedious calculations.[4] Both disciplines had practical applications during World War II; computers played a major role in wartime cryptography,[5] and quantum physics was essential for nuclear physics used in the Manhattan Project.[6] As physicists applied quantum mechanical models to computational problems and swapped digital bits for qubits, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science began to converge. In 1980, Paul Benioff introduced the quantum Turing machine, which uses quantum theory to describe a simplified computer.[7] When digital computers became faster, physicists faced an exponential increase in overhead when simulating quantum dynamics,[8] prompting Yuri Manin and Richard Feynman to independently suggest that hardware based on quantum phenomena might be more efficient for computer simulation.[9][10][11] In a 1984 paper, Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard applied quantum theory to cryptography protocols and demonstrated that quantum key distribution could enhance information security.[12][13] Quantum algorithms then emerged for solving oracle problems, such as Deutsch\\'s algorithm in 1985,[14] the Bernstein\u2013Vazirani algorithm in 1993,[15] and Simon\\'s algorithm in 1994.[16] These algorithms did not solve practical problems, but demonstrated mathematically that one could gain more information by querying a black box with a quantum state in superposition, sometimes referred to as quantum parallelism.[17] Peter Shor (pictured here in 2017) showed in 1994 that a scalable quantum computer would be able to break RSA encryption. Peter Shor built on these results with his 1994 algorithm for breaking the widely used RSA and Diffie\u2013Hellman encryption protocols,[18] which drew significant attention to the field of quantum computing. In 1996, Grover\\'s algorithm established a quantum speedup for the widely applicable unstructured search problem.[19][20] The same year, Seth Lloyd proved that quantum computers could simulate quantum systems without the exponential overhead present in classical simulations,[21] validating Feynman\\'s 1982 conjecture.[22] Over the years, experimentalists have constructed small-scale quantum computers using trapped ions and superconductors.[23] In 1998, a two-qubit quantum computer demonstrated the feasibility of the technology,[24][25] and subsequent experiments have increased the number of qubits and reduced error rates.[23] In 2019, Google AI and NASA announced that they had achieved quantum supremacy with a 54-qubit machine, performing a computation that is impossible for any classical computer.[26][27][28] However, the validity of this claim is still being actively researched.[29][30] Quantum information processing[edit] See also: Introduction to quantum mechanics Computer engineers typically describe a modern computer\\'s operation in terms of classical electrodynamics. Within these \"classical\" computers, some components (such as semiconductors and random number generators) may rely on quantum behavior, but these components are not isolated from their environment, so any quantum information quickly decoheres. While programmers may depend on probability theory when designing a randomized algorithm, quantum mechanical notions like superposition and interference are largely irrelevant for program analysis. Quantum programs, in contrast, rely on precise control of coherent quantum systems. Physicists describe these systems mathematically using linear algebra. Complex numbers model probability amplitudes, vectors model quantum states, and matrices model the operations that can be performed on these states. Programming a quantum computer is then a matter of composing operations in such a way that the resulting program computes a useful result in theory and is implementable in practice. As physicist Charlie Bennett describes the relationship between quantum and classical computers,[31] A classical computer is a quantum computer ... so we shouldn\\'t be asking about \"where do quantum speedups come from?\" We should say, \"well, all computers are quantum. ... Where do classical slowdowns come from?\" Quantum information[edit] Just as the bit is the basic concept of classical information theory, the qubit is the fundamental unit of quantum information. The same term qubit is used to refer to an abstract mathematical model and to any physical system that is represented by that model. A classical bit, by... [content truncated]')",

History[edit] For a chronological guide, see Timeline of quantum computing and communication. For many years, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science formed distinct academic communities.[1] Modern quantum theory developed in the 1920s to explain perplexing physical phenomena observed at atomic scales,[2][3] and digital computers emerged in the following decades to replace human computers for tedious calculations.[4] Both disciplines had practical applications during World War II; computers played a major role in wartime cryptography,[5] and quantum physics was essential for nuclear physics used in the Manhattan Project.[6] As physicists applied quantum mechanical models to computational problems and swapped digital bits for qubits, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science began to converge. In 1980, Paul Benioff introduced the quantum Turing machine, which uses quantum theory to describe a simplified computer.[7] When digital computers became faster, physicists faced an exponential increase in overhead when simulating quantum dynamics,[8] prompting Yuri Manin and Richard Feynman to independently suggest that hardware based on quantum phenomena might be more efficient for computer simulation.[9][10][11] In a 1984 paper, Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard applied quantum theory to cryptography protocols and demonstrated that quantum key distribution could enhance information security.[12][13] Quantum algorithms then emerged for solving oracle problems, such as Deutsch\\'s algorithm in 1985,[14], the Bernstein\\u2013Vazirani algorithm in 1993,[15], and Simon\\'s algorithm in 1994.[16] These algorithms did not solve practical problems, but demonstrated mathematically that one could gain more information by querying a black box with a quantum state in superposition, sometimes referred to as quantum parallelism.[17] Peter Shor (pictured here in 2017) showed in 1994 that a scalable quantum computer would be able to break RSA encryption. Peter Shor built on these results with his 1994 algorithm for breaking the widely used RSA and Diffie\\u2013Hellman encryption protocols,[18], which drew significant attention to the field of quantum computing. In 1996, Grover\\'s algorithm established a quantum speedup for the widely applicable unstructured search problem.[19][20] The same year, Seth Lloyd proved that quantum computers could simulate quantum systems without the exponential overhead present in classical simulations,[21], validating Feynman\\'s 1982 conjecture.[22] Over the years, experimentalists have constructed small-scale quantum computers using trapped ions and superconductors.[23] In 1998, a two-qubit quantum computer demonstrated the feasibility of the technology,[24][25], and subsequent experiments have increased the number of qubits and reduced error rates.[23] In 2019, Google AI and NASA announced that they had achieved quantum supremacy with a 54-qubit machine, performing a computation that is impossible for any classical computer.[26][27][28] However, the validity of this claim is still being actively researched.[29][30] Quantum information processing[edit] See also: Introduction to quantum mechanics Computer engineers typically describe a modern computer\\'s operation in terms of classical electrodynamics.

Quantum 10 June 2025 Link copied Authors Josh Schneider Senior Writer IBM Blog Ian Smalley Senior Editorial Strategist What is quantum computing? Quantum computing is an emergent field of computer science and engineering that harnesses the unique qualities of quantum mechanics to solve problems beyond the ability of even the most powerful classical computers. The field of quantum computing includes a range of disciplines, including quantum hardware and quantum algorithms. While still in development, quantum technology will soon be able to solve complex problems that classical supercomputers can\u2019t solve (or can\u2019t solve fast enough). By taking advantage of quantum physics, large-scale quantum computers would be able to tackle certain complex problems many times faster than modern classical machines. With a quantum computer, some problems that might take a classical computer thousands of years to solve might be solved in a matter of minutes or hours. Quantum mechanics, the study of physics at very small scales, reveals surprising fundamental natural principles. Quantum computers specifically harness these phenomena to access mathematical methods of solving problems not available with classical computing alone. Practical applications for quantum computing In practice, quantum computers are expected to be broadly useful for two types of tasks: modeling the behavior of physical systems and identifying patterns and structures in information. Quantum mechanics is a bit like the operating system of the universe. A computer that uses quantum mechanical principles to process information has certain advantages in modeling physical systems. Therefore, quantum computing is of particular interest for chemistry and material science applications. For example, quantum computers might help researchers seeking useful molecules for pharmaceutical or engineering applications identify candidates more quickly and efficiently. Quantum computers can also process data by using mathematical techniques not accessible to classical computers. That means they can give structure to data and help discover patterns that classical algorithms alone might miss. In practice, this might be useful for applications ranging from biology (for example, protein folding) to finance. Today, much of the work of quantum computing research involves searching for algorithms and applications within these broad categories of expected use. That is in addition to building the new technology itself. As leading institutions like IBM, Amazon, Microsoft and Google as well as startups like Rigetti and Ionq continue investing heavily in this exciting technology, quantum computing is estimated to become a USD 1.3 trillion industry by 2035.

Four key principles of quantum mechanics When discussing quantum computers, it is important to understand that at the smallest scales, the universe behaves very differently from what we are used to in our day-to-day lives. Compared to what we learned in grade-school physics, the behaviors of quantum objects are often bizarre and counterintuitive. Describing the behaviors of quantum particles presents a unique challenge. Most common-sense paradigms for the natural world lack the vocabulary to communicate the surprising behaviors of quantum particles. But quantum mechanics reveals how the universe really works. Quantum computers take advantage of quantum mechanics by replacing traditional binary bit circuits with quantum particles called quantum bits, or qubits. These particles behave differently from bits, exhibiting unique properties that can be described only with quantum mechanics. To understand quantum computing, it is important to understand four key quantum mechanics principles: SuperpositionEntanglementDecoherenceInterference Superposition A qubit itself isn't very useful. But it can place the quantum information it holds into a state of superposition, which represents a combination of all possible configurations of the qubit. Groups of qubits in superposition can create complex, multidimensional computational spaces. Complex problems can be represented in new ways in these spaces. When a quantum system is measured, its state collapses from a superposition of possibilities into a binary state, which can be registered like binary code as either a zero or a one. Entanglement Entanglement is the ability of qubits to correlate their state with other qubits. Entangled systems are so intrinsically linked that when quantum processors measure a single entangled qubit, they can immediately determine information about other qubits in the entangled system. Interference Interference is the engine of quantum computing. An environment of qubits placed into a state of collective superposition structures information in a way that looks like waves, with amplitudes associated with each outcome. These amplitudes become the probabilities of the outcomes of a measurement of the system. These waves can build on each other when many of them peak at a particular outcome or cancel each other out when peaks and troughs interact. Amplifying a probability or canceling out others are both forms of interference. Decoherence Decoherence is the process in which a system in a quantum state collapses into a nonquantum state. It can be intentionally triggered by measuring a quantum system or by other environmental factors (sometimes these factors trigger it unintentionally). Generally speaking, quantum computing requires avoiding and minimizing decoherence. How the principles work together To better understand quantum computing, consider that two surprising ideas are both true. The first is that objects that can be measured as having definite states\u2014qubits in superposition with defined probability amplitudes\u2014behave randomly. The second is that distant objects\u2014in this case, entangled qubits\u2014can still behave in ways that, though individually random, are strongly correlated. A computation on a quantum computer works by preparing a superposition of computational states. A quantum circuit, prepared by the user, uses operations to entangle qubits and generate interference patterns, as governed by a quantum algorithm. Many possible outcomes are canceled out through interference, while others are amplified. The amplified outcomes are the solutions to the computation. How do quantum computers work? The primary difference between classical and quantum computers is that quantum computers use qubits instead of bits. While quantum computing does use binary code, qubits process information differently from classical computers. But what are qubits and where do they come from? What are qubits? While classical computers rely on bits (zeros and ones) to store and process data, quantum computers process data differently by using quantum bits (qubits) in superposition. A qubit can behave like a bit and store either a zero or a one, but it can also be a weighted combination of zero and one at the same time. When qubits are combined, their superpositions can grow exponentially in complexity: two qubits can be in a superposition of the four possible 2-bit strings, three qubits can be in a superposition of the eight possible 3-bit strings, and so on. With 100 qubits, the range of possibilities is astronomical. Quantum algorithms work by manipulating information in a way inaccessible to classical computers, which can provide dramatic speed-ups for certain problems\u2014especially when quantum computers and high-performance cl...

Quantum 10 June 2025 Link copied Authors Josh Schneider Senior Writer IBM Blog Ian Smalley Senior Editorial Strategist What is quantum computing? Quantum computing is an emergent field of computer science and engineering that harnesses the unique qualities of quantum mechanics to solve problems beyond the ability of even the most powerful classical computers. The field of quantum computing includes a range of disciplines, including quantum hardware and quantum algorithms. While still in development, quantum technology will soon be able to solve complex problems that classical supercomputers can\u2019t solve (or can\u2019t solve fast enough). By taking advantage of quantum physics, large-scale quantum computers would be able to tackle certain complex problems many times faster than modern classical machines. With a quantum computer, some problems that might take a classical computer thousands of years to solve might be solved in a matter of minutes or hours. Quantum mechanics, the study of physics at very small scales, reveals surprising fundamental natural principles. Quantum computers specifically harness these phenomena to access mathematical methods of solving problems not available with classical computing alone. Practical applications for quantum computing In practice, quantum computers are expected to be broadly useful for two types of tasks: modeling the behavior of physical systems and identifying patterns and structures in information. Quantum mechanics is a bit like the operating system of the universe. A computer that uses quantum mechanical principles to process information has certain advantages in modeling physical systems. Therefore, quantum computing is of particular interest for chemistry and material science applications. For example, quantum computers might help researchers seeking useful molecules for pharmaceutical or engineering applications identify candidates more quickly and efficiently. Quantum computers can also process data by using mathematical techniques not accessible to classical computers. That means they can give structure to data and help discover patterns that classical algorithms alone might miss. In practice, this might be useful for applications ranging from biology (for example, protein folding) to finance. Today, much of the work of quantum computing research involves searching for algorithms and applications within these broad categories of expected use. That is in addition to building the new technology itself. As leading institutions like IBM, Amazon, Microsoft and Google as well as startups like Rigetti and Ionq continue investing heavily in this exciting technology, quantum computing is estimated to become a USD 1.3 trillion industry by 2035.

Four key principles of quantum mechanics When discussing quantum computers, it is important to understand that at the smallest scales, the universe behaves very differently from what we are used to in our day-to-day lives. Compared to what we learned in grade-school physics, the behaviors of quantum objects are often bizarre and counterintuitive. Describing the behaviors of quantum particles presents a unique challenge. Most common-sense paradigms for the natural world lack the vocabulary to communicate the surprising behaviors of quantum particles. But quantum mechanics reveals how the universe really works. Quantum computers take advantage of quantum mechanics by replacing traditional binary bit circuits with quantum particles called quantum bits, or qubits. These particles behave differently from bits, exhibiting unique properties that can be described only with quantum mechanics. To understand quantum computing, it is important to understand four key quantum mechanics principles: SuperpositionEntanglementDecoherenceInterference Superposition A qubit itself isn't very useful. But it can place the quantum information it holds into a state of superposition, which represents a combination of all possible configurations of the qubit. Groups of qubits in superposition can create complex, multidimensional computational spaces. Complex problems can be represented in new ways in these spaces. When a quantum system is measured, its state collapses from a superposition of possibilities into a binary state, which can be registered like binary code as either a zero or a one. Entanglement Entanglement is the ability of qubits to correlate their state with other qubits. Entangled systems are so intrinsically linked that when quantum processors measure a single entangled qubit, they can immediately determine information about other qubits in the entangled system. Interference Interference is the engine of quantum computing. An environment of qubits placed into a state of collective superposition structures information in a way that looks like waves, with amplitudes associated with each outcome. These amplitudes become the probabilities of the outcomes of a measurement of the system. These waves can build on each other when many of them peak at a particular outcome or cancel each other out when peaks and troughs interact. Amplifying a probability or canceling out others are both forms of interference. Decoherence Decoherence is the process in which a system in a quantum state collapses into a nonquantum state. It can be intentionally triggered by measuring a quantum system or by other environmental factors (sometimes these factors trigger it unintentionally). Generally speaking, quantum computing requires avoiding and minimizing decoherence. How the principles work together To better understand quantum computing, consider that two surprising ideas are both true. The first is that objects that can be measured as having definite states\u2014qubits in superposition with defined probability amplitudes\u2014behave randomly. The second is that distant objects\u2014in this case, entangled qubits\u2014can still behave in ways that, though individually random, are strongly correlated. A computation on a quantum computer works by preparing a superposition of computational states. A quantum circuit, prepared by the user, uses operations to entangle qubits and generate interference patterns, as governed by a quantum algorithm. Many possible outcomes are canceled out through interference, while others are amplified. The amplified outcomes are the solutions to the computation. How do quantum computers work? The primary difference between classical and quantum computers is that quantum computers use qubits instead of bits. While quantum computing does use binary code, qubits process information differently from classical computers. But what are qubits and where do they come from? What are qubits? While classical computers rely on bits (zeros and ones) to store and process data, quantum computers process data differently by using quantum bits (qubits) in superposition. A qubit can behave like a bit and store either a zero or a one, but it can also be a weighted combination of zero and one at the same time. When qubits are combined, their superpositions can grow exponentially in complexity: two qubits can be in a superposition of the four possible 2-bit strings, three qubits can be in a superposition of the eight possible 3-bit strings, and so on. With 100 qubits, the range of possibilities is astronomical. Quantum algorithms work by manipulating information in a way inaccessible to classical computers, which can provide dramatic speed-ups for certain problems\u2014especially when quantum computers and high-performance cl...

A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena. On small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing takes advantage of this behavior using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster[a] than any modern \\\"classical\\\" computer. Theoretically a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the art is largely experimental and impractical, with several obstacles to useful applications. The basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or \\\"quantum bit\\\"), serves the same function as the bit in classical computing. However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two \\\"basis\\\" states, a state that is in an abstract sense \\\"between\\\" the two basis states. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently and quickly. Quantum computers are not yet practical for real-world applications. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven to be challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research aimed at developing scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Example implementations include superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields). In principle, a classical computer can solve the same computational problems as a quantum computer, given enough time. Quantum advantage comes in the form of time complexity rather than computability, and quantum complexity theory shows that some quantum algorithms are exponentially more efficient than the best-known classical algorithms. A large-scale quantum computer could in theory solve computational problems that are not solvable within a reasonable timeframe for a classical computer. This concept of additional ability has been called \\\"quantum supremacy\\\". While such claims have drawn significant attention to the discipline, near-term practical use cases remain limited. History[edit] For a chronological guide, see Timeline of quantum computing and communication. For many years, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science formed distinct academic communities.[1] Modern quantum theory developed in the 1920s to explain perplexing physical phenomena observed at atomic scales,[2][3] and digital computers emerged in the following decades to replace human computers for tedious calculations.[4] Both disciplines had practical applications during World War II; computers played a major role in wartime cryptography,[5] and quantum physics was essential for nuclear physics used in the Manhattan Project.[6] As physicists applied quantum mechanical models to computational problems and swapped digital bits for qubits, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science began to converge. In 1980, Paul Benioff introduced the quantum Turing machine, which uses quantum theory to describe a simplified computer.[7] When digital computers became faster, physicists faced an exponential increase in overhead when simulating quantum dynamics,[8] prompting Yuri Manin and Richard Feynman to independently suggest that hardware based on quantum phenomena might be more efficient for computer simulation.[9][10][11] In a 1984 paper, Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard applied quantum theory to cryptography protocols and demonstrated that quantum key distribution could enhance information security.[12][13] Quantum algorithms then emerged for solving oracle problems, such as Deutsch\\'s algorithm in 1985,[14], the Bernstein\\u2013Vazirani algorithm in 1993,[15], and Simon\\'s algorithm in 1994.[16] These algorithms did not solve practical problems, but demonstrated mathematically that one could gain more information by querying a black box with a quantum state in superposition, sometimes referred to as quantum parallelism.[17] Peter Shor (pictured here in 2017) showed in 1994 that a scalable quantum computer would be able to break RSA encryption. Peter Shor built on these results with his 1994 algorithm for breaking the widely used RSA and Diffie\\u2013Hellman encryption protocols,[18], which drew significant attention to the field of quantum computing. In 1996, Grover\\'s algorithm established a quantum speedup for the widely applicable unstructured search problem.[19][20] The same year, Seth Lloyd proved that quantum computers could simulate quantum systems without the exponential overhead present in classical simulations,[21], validating Feynman\\'s 1982 conjecture.[22] Over the years, experimentalists have constructed small-scale quantum computers using trapped ions and superconductors.[23] In 1998, a two-qubit quantum computer demonstrated the feasibility of the technology,[24][25], and subsequent experiments have increased the number of qubits and reduced error rates.[23] In 2019, Google AI and NASA announced that they had achieved quantum supremacy with a 54-qubit machine, performing a computation that is impossible for any classical computer.[26][27][28] However, the validity of this claim is still being actively researched.[29][30] Quantum information processing[edit] See also: Introduction to quantum mechanics Computer engineers typically describe a modern computer\\'s operation in terms of classical electrodynamics. Within these \\\"classical\\\" computers, some components (such as semiconductors and random number generators) may rely on quantum behavior, but these components are not isolated from their environment, so any quantum information quickly decoheres. While programmers may depend on probability theory when designing a randomized algorithm, quantum mechanical notions like superposition and interference are largely irrelevant for program analysis. Quantum programs, in contrast, rely on precise control of coherent quantum systems. Physicists describe these systems mathematically using linear algebra. Complex numbers model probability amplitudes, vectors model quantum states, and matrices model the operations that can be performed on these states. Programming a quantum computer is then a matter of composing operations in such a way that the resulting program computes a useful result in theory and is implementable in practice. As physicist Charlie Bennett describes the relationship between quantum and classical computers,[31] A classical computer is a quantum computer ... so we shouldn\\'t be asking about \\\"where do quantum speedups come from?\\\" We should say, \\\"well, all computers are quantum. ... Where do classical slowdowns come from?\\\" Quantum information[edit] Just as the bit is the basic concept of classical information theory, the qubit is the fundamental unit of quantum information. The same term qubit is used to refer to an abstract mathematical model and to any physical system that is represented by that model. A classical bit, by...
