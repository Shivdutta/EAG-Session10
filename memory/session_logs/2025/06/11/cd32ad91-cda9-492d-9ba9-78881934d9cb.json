An Open Source Philosophy ** There was much excitement over Elon Musk\u2019s support for open innovation. [70] In his address, Elon Musk commented: \u2018We believe that applying the open source philosophy to our patents will strengthen rather than diminish Tesla\u2019s position in this regard.\u2019 [ 71] The use of open source strategies to encourage collaboration and disseminate new technologies has a long tradition. Richard Stallman was groundbreaking in his use of free software licences to ensure that computer code was accessible. [72] Open source developers used open source licensing to support their information technology products and services. Lawrence Lessig helped set up the Creative Commons in order to facilitate accessible licensing across a wide range of copyright works. [73] Open source strategies have also been adopted in other fields of endeavour. There has been open source tactics deployed in respect of plant breeding and agriculture. As documented by Glyn Moody, the biological sciences have used open source licensing in response to the proliferation of gene patents and 70 Abby Martin, \u2018Tesla\u2019s Electric Car Patent Revolution\u2019, Breaking the Set, 13 June 2014, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v = acEi1RG2uIw&feature = youtu.be 71 Elon Musk, \u2018All Our Patents Belong to You\u2019, Tesla Motors, 12 June 2014, http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all - our - patent - are - belong - you 72 Richard Stallman, https://stallman.org/ 73 Lawrence Lessig, *Code And Other Laws Of Cyberspace*, New York, NY: Basic Books, 1999; Lawrence Lessig, *The Future Of Ideas: The Fate Of The Commons In A Connected World*, New York: Random House, 2001; Lawrence Lessig, *Free Culture: How Big Media Uses Technology And Law To* *Lockdown Culture And Control Creativity*, New York: Penguin, 2004; and Lawrence Lessig, *Remix: Making Art* *and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy*, New York: The Penguin Press, 2008. 21 ----- ## commercial databases. [74] There has been experimentation with open source strategies in the field of medicine \u2014 such as in open drug discovery. Elon Musk\u2019s decision to adopt an open source philosophy in respect of electric cars has precedents in the area of clean technologies. In my book Intellectual Property and Climate Change: Inventing Clean Technologies, I explored a number of examples of co-operative strategies in respect of intellectual property and clean technologies. [75] There has been a great deal of interest in innovation networks, patent pools, technology clearing houses, and open source strategies. The UNFCCC Climate Technology Centre and Network has been established to encourage research, development, and diffusion of clean technologies.

See [markitdown-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/tree/main/packages/markitdown-mcp) for more information. Important Breaking changes between 0.0.1 to 0.1.0: * Dependencies are now organized into optional feature-groups (further details below). Use `pip install \\'markitdown[all]\\'` to have backward-compatible behavior. * convert\\\\_stream() now requires a binary file-like object (e.g., a file opened in binary mode, or an io.BytesIO object). This is a breaking change from the previous version, where it previously also accepted text file-like objects, like io.StringIO. * The DocumentConverter class interface has changed to read from file-like streams rather than file paths. _No temporary files are created anymore_. If you are the maintainer of a plugin, or custom DocumentConverter, you likely need to update your code. Otherwise, if only using the MarkItDown class or CLI (as in these examples), you should not need to change anything. MarkItDown is a lightweight Python utility for converting various files to Markdown for use with LLMs and related text analysis pipelines. To this end, it is most comparable to [textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract), but with a focus on preserving important document structure and content as Markdown (including: headings, lists, tables, links, etc.) While the output is often reasonably presentable and human-friendly, it is meant to be consumed by text analysis tools -- and may not be the best option for high-fidelity document conversions for human consumption. At present, MarkItDown supports: * PDF * PowerPoint * Word * Excel * Images (EXIF metadata and OCR) * Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription) * HTML * Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML) * ZIP files (iterates over contents) * Youtube URLs * EPubs * ... and more! Why Markdown? ------------- [](#why-markdown) Markdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still provides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as OpenAI\\'s GPT-4o, natively \"_speak_\" Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their responses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of Markdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions are also highly token-efficient. Installation ------------ [](#installation) To install MarkItDown, use pip: `pip install \\'markitdown[all]\\'`. Alternatively, you can install it from the source: ``` git clone git@github.com:microsoft/markitdown.git cd markitdown pip install -e \\'packages/markitdown[all]\\' ``` Usage ----- [](#usage) ### Command-Line [](#command-line) ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf > document.md ``` Or use `-o` to specify the output file: ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md ``` You can also pipe content: ``` cat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown ``` ### Optional Dependencies [](#optional-dependencies) MarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats. Earlier in this document, we installed all optional dependencies with the `[all]` option. However, you can also install them individually for more control. For example: ``` pip install \\'markitdown[pdf, docx, pptx]\\' ``` will install only the dependencies for PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files. At the moment, the following optional dependencies are available: * `[all]` Installs all optional dependencies *\\n[Source: markitdown.md, ID: markitdown_0]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text=\"and sharing 3rd party plugins.

An Open Source Philosophy ** There was much excitement over Elon Musk\u2019s support for open innovation. [70] In his address, Elon Musk commented: \u2018We believe that applying the open source philosophy to our patents will strengthen rather than diminish Tesla\u2019s position in this regard.\u2019 [ 71] The use of open source strategies to encourage collaboration and disseminate new technologies has a long tradition. Richard Stallman was groundbreaking in his use of free software licences to ensure that computer code was accessible. [72] Open source developers used open source licensing to support their information technology products and services. Lawrence Lessig helped set up the Creative Commons in order to facilitate accessible licensing across a wide range of copyright works. [73] Open source strategies have also been adopted in other fields of endeavour. There has been open source tactics deployed in respect of plant breeding and agriculture. As documented by Glyn Moody, the biological sciences have used open source licensing in response to the proliferation of gene patents and 70 Abby Martin, \u2018Tesla\u2019s Electric Car Patent Revolution\u2019, Breaking the Set, 13 June 2014, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v = acEi1RG2uIw&feature = youtu.be 71 Elon Musk, \u2018All Our Patents Belong to You\u2019, Tesla Motors, 12 June 2014, http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all - our - patent - are - belong - you 72 Richard Stallman, https://stallman.org/ 73 Lawrence Lessig, *Code And Other Laws Of Cyberspace*, New York, NY: Basic Books, 1999; Lawrence Lessig, *The Future Of Ideas: The Fate Of The Commons In A Connected World*, New York: Random House, 2001; Lawrence Lessig, *Free Culture: How Big Media Uses Technology And Law To* *Lockdown Culture And Control Creativity*, New York: Penguin, 2004; and Lawrence Lessig, *Remix: Making Art* *and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy*, New York: The Penguin Press, 2008. 21 ----- ## commercial databases. [74] There has been experimentation with open source strategies in the field of medicine \u2014 such as in open drug discovery. Elon Musk\u2019s decision to adopt an open source philosophy in respect of electric cars has precedents in the area of clean technologies. In my book Intellectual Property and Climate Change: Inventing Clean Technologies, I explored a number of examples of co-operative strategies in respect of intellectual property and clean technologies. [75] There has been a great deal of interest in innovation networks, patent pools, technology clearing houses, and open source strategies. The UNFCCC Climate Technology Centre and Network has been established to encourage research, development, and diffusion of clean technologies.

See [markitdown-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/tree/main/packages/markitdown-mcp) for more information. Important Breaking changes between 0.0.1 to 0.1.0: * Dependencies are now organized into optional feature-groups (further details below). Use `pip install \\'markitdown[all]\\'` to have backward-compatible behavior. * convert\\\\_stream() now requires a binary file-like object (e.g., a file opened in binary mode, or an io.BytesIO object). This is a breaking change from the previous version, where it previously also accepted text file-like objects, like io.StringIO. * The DocumentConverter class interface has changed to read from file-like streams rather than file paths. _No temporary files are created anymore_. If you are the maintainer of a plugin, or custom DocumentConverter, you likely need to update your code. Otherwise, if only using the MarkItDown class or CLI (as in these examples), you should not need to change anything. MarkItDown is a lightweight Python utility for converting various files to Markdown for use with LLMs and related text analysis pipelines. To this end, it is most comparable to [textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract), but with a focus on preserving important document structure and content as Markdown (including: headings, lists, tables, links, etc.) While the output is often reasonably presentable and human-friendly, it is meant to be consumed by text analysis tools -- and may not be the best option for high-fidelity document conversions for human consumption. At present, MarkItDown supports: * PDF * PowerPoint * Word * Excel * Images (EXIF metadata and OCR) * Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription) * HTML * Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML) * ZIP files (iterates over contents) * Youtube URLs * EPubs * ... and more! Why Markdown? ------------- [](#why-markdown) Markdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still provides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as OpenAI\\'s GPT-4o, natively \"_speak_\" Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their responses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of Markdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions are also highly token-efficient. Installation ------------ [](#installation) To install MarkItDown, use pip: `pip install \\'markitdown[all]\\'`. Alternatively, you can install it from the source: ``` git clone git@github.com:microsoft/markitdown.git cd markitdown pip install -e \\'packages/markitdown[all]\\' ``` Usage ----- [](#usage) ### Command-Line [](#command-line) ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf > document.md ``` Or use `-o` to specify the output file: ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md ``` You can also pipe content: ``` cat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown ``` ### Optional Dependencies [](#optional-dependencies) MarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats. Earlier in this document, we installed all optional dependencies with the `[all]` option. However, you can also install them individually for more control. For example: ``` pip install \\'markitdown[pdf, docx, pptx]\\' ``` will install only the dependencies for PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files. At the moment, the following optional dependencies are available: * `[all]` Installs all optional dependencies *\\n[Source: markitdown.md, ID: markitdown_0]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text=\"and sharing 3rd party plugins.
